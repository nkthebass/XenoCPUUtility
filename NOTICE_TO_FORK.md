Hi, I am the author of XenoCPUUtility. I see you have a fork of my project from when it was under the MIT license.
​I have recently moved the project to a Proprietary/Restricted license and am enforcing strict branding guidelines to prevent user confusion and broken installers.
​While you have the right to the code from the MIT version, you do not have permission to use the name 'XenoCPUUtility' for your fork. This is causing users to download your version thinking it is the official, maintained release.
​Please rename your repository to something distinct (e.g., 'Xeno-Fork-Old') within 7 days. If the repository remains under my project's name, I will have to file a formal Trademark/Impersonation report with GitHub to protect my brand.
