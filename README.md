This project does take use of "vibe coding" rest be assured it is far from being "AI slop".

## Overview
XenoCPUUtility is a **comprehensive CPU benchmarking and stress testing utility** designed to measure single-core and multi-core performance, thread scaling, floating-point throughput, integer workload behavior, and sustained CPU stability across modern processors.

It features **deterministic workloads**, real-time hardware monitoring, CPU instability detection (WHEA errors), and configurable stress testing modes for validation and overclocking verification. 

---

## System Requirements
* **OS:** Windows 10 or 11
* **RAM:** 2GB minimum
* **Storage:** 200MB free space
* **CPU:** Intel 2nd Gen or newer, AMD FX or newer (or ARM-compatible)

*Note: As of v1.9.0, legacy CPU support (Intel 1st Gen, AMD Phenom/Athlon K10) is not included. A legacy version is planned for future release.*

## Features

### 🎯 Benchmarking
- **Single-Core Benchmark:** Measures peak single-thread floating-point performance
- **Multi-Core Benchmark:** Aggregates all CPU threads for total throughput
- **Path Tracing Benchmark**  Measures path tracing performance with thread configurability 
- **Configurable Runs:** Average multiple benchmark runs for stability
- **CPU Comparison Charts:** Compare your score against 11+ reference CPUs (horizontally and vertically scrollable)
- **Histogram Distribution:** Visualize score variance across runs
  

### 💪 Stress Testing
- **Heavy Load Mode:** Continuous sqrt/sin/cos workload for sustained 95-100% CPU saturation
- **Instability Check Mode:** 4-phase rotating workload (FP-heavy → Integer → Memory pointer-chasing → Mixed bandwidth) with periodic idle dips and thread desynchronization to detect marginal CPU instabilities and voltage droops
- **Configurable Threads:** Manual or auto-detect (up to system core count)
- **Pause/Resume:** Temporarily suspend testing without losing progress
- **Execution Control:** Hidden background processes for non-intrusive testing

### ⚡ Hardware Monitoring & Diagnostics
- **WHEA Error Tab:** Real-time Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA) event monitoring for CPU instability detection
- **Real-Time Metrics:** CPU utilization, RAM usage
- **Alerts Tab:** Event logging and system health notifications
- **CPU Info Panel:** Hardware details (model, max clock, core/thread count)

### ⚙️ UI & Controls
- **5 Sidebar Tabs:** 
  - ⚡ **WHEA** — CPU error monitoring
  - ⚠️ **Alerts** — System notifications
  - ⚙️ **Settings** — Configuration
  - 📊 **Benchmarks** — CPU comparison scores
  - ℹ️ **About** — Program info & features
- **Synchronized Tab Closing:** Tabs auto-close when another opens for clean workflow
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for 1920×1080 and higher resolutions

## Architecture

### Benchmarking Engine
- **Synchronization:** ManualResetEventSlim start barriers ensure all threads begin simultaneously
- **Per-Thread Isolation:** Each thread maintains ~2MB private buffer to prevent cache contention
- **Workload:** Math-heavy FP operations (sqrt, sin, cos) + private buffer access + PCG-style LCG generator
- **Batching:** 1024 ops per timer check to minimize measurement overhead
- **Normalization:** Single-core (624k), Multi-core (91k) for consistent cross-platform scoring

### Stress Testing Engine
- **Heavy Load:** Continuous floating-point saturation (sqrt/sin/cos loop)
- **Instability Check:** Multi-phase workload with idle bursts and thread desynchronization for voltage droop detection
