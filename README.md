This is the XenoCPUUtility I made to provide a quick, easy, and reliable CPU benchmarking software
for both multicore and single core along with a built in variable thread and ram stress test this software becomes somewhat useful.

How does the benchmarking work? The program makes your CPU run calculations over a set amount of time then takes the OPS and generates a score like 121.98 for example,
the software then takes your score and puts it on the single or multicore benchmarking bar-graph-chart accesable through the graphing tab on the right side of the GUI.
The graphing tab also provides real-time CPU speed, frequency and ram usage graphs below the performance charts.
The tab above it is the settings tab that provides the you with the ability to change the color of the GUI text and windows.
The next tab up is the ram stress testing tab that provides real time data while the ram stress test is running on how much data is flowing and the amount of errors found (hopefully none)
