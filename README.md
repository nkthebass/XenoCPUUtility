XenoCPUUtility is a **CPU benchmarking and stress testing utility**
designed to measure **single-core and multi-core performance**,
thread scaling, floating-point throughput, integer workload behavior,
and sustained CPU stability across modern processors.

It supports **Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs**, with configurable thread counts
and deterministic workloads suitable for benchmarking, validation,
and stress testing.

## Features
- Deterministic CPU benchmarking workloads.
- Single-core and multi-core scaling tests.
- Configurable thread counts (up to 64 threads or 32 cores)
- Floating-point and integer workload coverage.
- Designed for Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures.
- Lightweight, no background services.
- Ram stress testing from 256mb's of ram to 128gb's
- Supports 2nd gen and newer intel along with AMD fx cpus and newer
